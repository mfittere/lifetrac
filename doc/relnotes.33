                            Software Version: 3.3

                            November 2003

1. OVERVIEW.

   The Beam-Beam code LIFETRAC is intended for simulation of the equilibrium
   distribution of the particles in circular electron-positron colliders.
   One of the important features is the capability of simulating the beam's
   halo and lifetime. A special tracking technique has been developed, which
   allows to save huge amount of CPU time for such long-term simulations.
   Besides, there is a possibility of simulating non-equilibrium distributions,
   for example proton beams (which have very small damping), or beams with
   external excitations depending on time, or some parameters' dependence on
   time.

   Description of the input and output syntax can be found in the following
   files:
     readme.txt   - overview and command line directives
     taskfile.hlp - description of the "task" files
     work_pnt.hlp - description of the "passport" (parameters of the working
                    point)
     out_data.hlp - description of the output



2. NEW FEATURES AND CORRECTIONS IN THE VERSION 3.3.

2.1 Misprint in the keyword GAMMA_WEAK fixed.

   In the previous Version it was a misprint in the keyword GAMMA_WEAK, which
   was written as HAMMA_WEAK. Now it is fixed.


2.2 Number of turns for steps for non-equilibrium distributions.

   In the previous Version the last 10 turns of each step were accounted
   separately and the corresponding statistics were written to the "ltr" file
   with the special marks. In the Version 3.3 it was generalized as follows.
   The number of turns now can be defined by two different ways. If a single
   number is given without parentheses, it means that all the steps will have
   the same number of turns (without separate accounting of the last 10 turns).
   Another possibility is to write two numbers within perentheses, separated
   by a comma. In this case the first one is the number of turns for the ODD
   steps (1,3,5,...), and the second one - for the EVEN steps (2,4,6,...).
   For example:
     Boundary:   (part)=10000     (step)=(100,50000)
   So, the short steps represent the snapshots of the distribution, separated
   by the long steps, while the long steps represent the distribution averaged
   over longer time, having much better statistical reliability. The duration
   of "odd" and "even" steps can be chosen arbitrary.


2.3 Initial distribution for non-equilibrium case.

   In the previous Version the initial 6D particle distribution was always
   Gausian. In the Version 3.3 a possibility of using arbitrary initial
   distributions was introduced by mean of the new kyeword in the first
   passport section (General Parameters):
     DISTR_INIT: filename
   Where filename is a text file with 7-column table of particles' coordinates
   (physical or normalized) and weights.


2.4 Crossing angle and Crab-crossing.

   In the previous Version only small crossing angles were allowed. In the
   Version 3.3 arbitrary crossing angles can be used. Besides, a "crab"
   rotation of the strong bunch can be defined with the new keyword CRAB
   in IP element description.


2.5 Coupling in LATT elements.

   The 4D lattice functions can be defined in LATT elements according to the
   V.Lebedev and S.Bogacz paper "Betatron Motion with Coupling of Horizontal
   and Vertical Degrees of Freedom". When such LATT elements are referenced
   from LIN elements, they define 6*6 transport matrixes with coupling. When
   referenced from IP elements, they are used to calculate the second-order
   moments, which define in general case the strong beam shape versus
   longitudinal coordinate (azimuth).

2.5.1 New keywords in LATT element description.

   The new keywords BETA_C, ALPHA_C and COUPLING can be used to define the
   coupled lattice functions. COUPLING defines the U and V1 parameters,
   which can be calculated from betas and alphas, but with some ambiguity.
   These two parameters are used to choose one solution from 2*2 possible
   variants.

2.5.2 Lattice propagation.

   In the previous Version the lattice functions, when referenced, could
   be propagated through the sequence of uncoupled matrixes only. In the
   Version 3.3 any matrixes (coupling is allowed) can be used for lattice
   propagation.

2.5.3 Printing the lattice functions, etc.

   When the command line argument -v (for verbose) is used, the code prints
   the tunes, beta, alpha (with coupling) and dispersion functions at the
   watching point, and the same functions for shifted by 5*sigma_E energy.
   At the end, the chromaticity of betatron tunes and beta-functions are
   given. If the -vv switch is used, the 6*6 one-turn transport matrix will
   be printed in addition.


2.6 New keyword M_56 for LIN elements.

   Instead of using synchrotron tune advance for LIN elements, one may
   define the M_56 matrix element by mean of the keyword "M_56". In this
   case the right-lower corner of the transport matrix will be
   (1  M_56)  instead of  (cos  -sin)
   (0    1 )              (sin   cos)
   One can specify either synchrotron tune or M_56 for LIN element, but
   not both of them. Note also that, when using M_56, RF cavity should be
   included in the STRUCTURE explicitly in order to make the synchrotron
   motion stable.


2.7 Changes in 2D distribution processing.

   In the previous Version the vertical cell size was changed with the step
   number. In the Version 3.3 both cell sizes (horizontal and vertical) are
   constant for all the steps and can be defined in the passport section.
   The algorithm of 2D distribution processing also was changed, that caused
   some changes in the output data written to the *.ltr files.

2.7.1 New keyword CELL_SIZE for WATCH element.

   The keyword CELL_SIZE is added to the WATCH element description. If the
   keyword is omitted, the both cell sizes (horizontal and vertical) are
   assumed to be 0.02. Correspondingly, CELL_SIZE is excluded from the data
   written to the *.ltr file for the sequential steps.

2.7.2 Line_border is replaced by Max_ampl.

   In the previous Version the border lines (marked as Line_border) were used
   on each step to define the area where the 2D distribution is gathered. In
   the Version 3.3 there is no such limitation, and correspondingly there are
   no border lines. Instead, the maximum reached amplitudes are given for
   sequential steps after the keyword MAX_AMPL.

2.7.3 Line_reach changes its meaning.

   In the previous Version the Line_reach was used to define the maximum
   "vertical" amplitude reached by the particle, versus the "horizontal"
   amplitude. In the Version 3.3 it is the border of 2D area where the
   particles were found during the given step. So, now it becomes more
   informative. The Line_reach is obtained only after completion of the
   step and is written just before the level lines.


2.8 Changes in the "Export: (HIST)" action.

   In the previous Version no option must be present after the (HIST)
   sub-keyword. In the Version 3.3 either GAUSS or ERFC option must be
   specified. The last one is equivalent to the old-style output. The
   GAUSS option is used to produce normal histograms of 1D distribution
   density. See the files taskfile.hlp and out_data.hlp for more
   information.


2.9 Writing the output to stdout instead of files.

   The actions TRACK and EXPORT now can write its output to stdout, instead
   of *.trac, *.hist and *.line files. To do so, use "=>" instead of "=" in
   the action specification (in taskfile), for example:
      Track:  100   (norm)=>(1,1,1,1,1,1)
      Export: (hist)=>Gauss    (line)=>half


2.10 Obsolete features removed.

   Support of the output files produced by the LIFETRAC Versions elder
   than 3.1 is cancelled. If necessary, the new file (working point) can
   be created with the corresponding input parameters, and processed by
   the current code LIFETRAC Version 3.3.

   Support of the code running on VMS operating system is cancelled too.
   At present, the code can be executed on UNIX systems only.
