1. OVERVIEW.

   The Beam-Beam code LIFETRAC is intended for simulation of the equilibrium
   distribution of the particles in circular electron-positron colliders.
   One of the important features is the capability of simulating the beam's
   halo and lifetime. A special tracking technique has been developed, which
   allows to save huge amount of CPU time for such long-term simulations.
   Besides, there is a possibility of simulating non-equilibrium distributions,
   for example proton beams (which have very small damping), or beams with
   external excitations depending on time, or some parameters' dependence on
   time.

   Description of the input and output syntax can be found in the following
   files:
     readme.txt   - overview and command line directives
     taskfile.hlp - description of the "task" files
     out_data.hlp - description of the output



2. NEW FEATURES AND CORRECTIONS IN THE VERSION 3.31.

2.1 Non-Gaussian strong bunch.

   The strong bunch can be represented as a sum of two or three bunches with
   different transverse emittances. This feature allows using in simulations
   non-Gaussian strong bunches. For that, the following lines can be written
   in the "General Parameters" section (before Structure):

      Emitt_str1 (cm*rad):  (x)=2.56E-5       (y)=1.75E-6       (w)=0.345
      Emitt_str2 (cm*rad):  (x)=3.68E-5       (y)=2.34E-6       (w)=0.234

   The relative "weight" of harmonic is equal to 1.0 for Emitt_str and (w) for
   Emitt_str1 and Emitt_str2. If the (w) value is not defined, it is assumed
   to be zero by default. The ksi parameter is defined in assumption that
   there is only one main harmonic in strong bunch's emittance: Emitt_str.
   This is used to obtain the strong bunch's intensity I_0. For tracking, the
   intensities of harmonics are equal to I_0/S, I_0*w1/S and I_0*w2/S, where
   S=1+w1+w2.


2.2 Number of particles to track.

   The limit for the number of particles was increased from 10^4 to 10^6.
   Note that the product npart*nturn must be <= 2*10^9, otherwise data will
   be corrupted due to integer overflow. Here "npart" is the number of
   particles to track, and "nturn" is the number of turns for a step. Both
   these parameters are defined by the "Boundary" options: (part) and (step).


2.3 New element type EXT_WTCH.

   This is an "extension" to standard LIFETRAC's set of elements, as well as
   all EXT_**** element types. However, it is more complicated than all the
   previous EXT_**** elements and requires a detailed explanation, which is
   given below.
      This element takes an effect for non-equilibrium distributions only,
   otherwise it is ignored (no errors printed). One may insert a few such
   elements at different points on the ring. There are two input parameters,
   with the standard names: Value_1 and Value_2. By default, as usual, both
   of them are equal to zero.
      The first value is the number of turns to gather the beam coordinates
   (center of mass over all the particles). Zero means gathering all the
   turns. If Value_1 < 0, the beam coordinates will not be saved. The second
   value is the "accuracy" of beam coordinates: they are measured in units of
   Value_2. If Value_2 <= 0, it is set to 1.0E-5 (that is 0.1 mkm). The
   greater Value_2 is, the shorter will be the output. After completion of
   each step the beam coordinates will be packed like histograms and written
   to "*.ltr" file. One should use a special Export directive in taskfile to
   extract these data:
          Export: (wtch)=(n1:n2)
   where n1 and n2 are the turn numbers, 0 means the last written turn,
   negative values are accounted from the last one. For example, to extract
   the last 4096 turns (for FFT analysis), one should include the following
   line in taskfile:
          Export: (wtch)=(-4095:0)
   Then, the "*.wtch" text file will be created with four columns: coord_x,
   coord_y, coord_z, and turn_number. If there are a few EXT_WTCH elements on
   the ring, the fifth column (tag) will be added (e.g. #01, #02). As usual,
   the output can be redirected to stdout: use "=>" instead of "=" in the
   Export directive.
      Besides, after completion of each step the beam sizes (Gauss-fitted)
   will be also printed to "*.ltr" file. Use
          grep Sizes filename.ltr
   to extract these data.


2.4 Changes in taskfiles.

   The keywords INPUT and REDUCE are removed. If one want to create a
   new *.ltr file, all the parameters must be defined in a "passport"
   section within taskfile.
