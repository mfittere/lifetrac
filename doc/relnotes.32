1. OVERVIEW.

   The Beam-Beam code LIFETRAC is intended for simulation of the equilibrium
   distribution of the particles in circular electron-positron colliders.
   One of the important features is the capability of simulating the beam's
   halo and lifetime. A special tracking technique has been developed, which
   allows to save huge amount of CPU time for such long-term simulations.
   Besides, there is a possibility of simulating non-equilibrium distributions,
   for example proton beams (which have very small damping), or beams with
   external excitations depending on time, or some parameters' dependence on
   time.

   Description of the input and output syntax can be found in the following
   files:
     readme.txt   - overview and command-line directives
     explain.tsk  - description of the "task" files
     explain.psp  - description of the "passport" (parameters of the working
                    point)
     explain.out  - description of the output



2. NEW FEATURES AND CORRECTIONS IN THE VERSION 3.2.

2.1 New Random Number Generator.

   In the previous Version the RNG's RNDM and NORRAN were used, taken from
   CERNLIB. In the Version 3.2 the COMBO generator is used, taken from
   G. Marsaglia's set of RNG's. Consequently, the sub-keywords for the SEED
   keyword were replaced: (comb_1), (comb_2) and (comb_3) instead of (rndm),
   (norr_1) and (norr_2).


2.2 Normalization transformation.

   In the Version 3.2 the Normalization transformation is generalized in
   order to allow any 6D coupling. First of all, a 6*6 transport matrix is
   obtained by the tracking. Then, the eigenvalues (that give us the tunes of
   the normal modes) and eigenvectors are calculated from this matrix. The
   eigenvectors are used to find the normal modes and the normalization
   matrix.

2.2.1 New keyword NORM for IP elements.

   When calculating the transport matrix, the IP elements (beam-beam
   interaction) can be either included (Norm: ON) or excluded (Norm: OFF). By
   default, it is ON.

2.2.2 WATCH element description.

   The keywords LATT_WEAK and TRANSFORM were excluded from the element's
   description, since the normalization matrix is obtained directly from the
   transport matrix. So, in most cases the WATCH element description is empty.
   However, the keywords EMITT_WEAK and SIGMA_WEAK are allowed, which may
   override the values specified in the section "General Parameters", causing
   "renormalization" of the obtained distributions.
